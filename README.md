# sna_py
Python scripts for PhD social network analysis

Graph objects created using iGraph R package. Network visualisations in R produce mixed results. Tried using ggnet, ggnetwork, sna, and network R packages as well as built in iGraph plotting functions. 

Use rgefx package in R to convert iGraph objects to Gephi GEXF files. Import these into networkx python library to create nice visualisations using seaborn.
